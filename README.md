# ClientServerUsingNamedPipes

This repository is only used to generate the ClientServerUsingNamedPipes.dll used in the FS_Telemetry_Server application. It is a branch of this code example here: https://github.com/IfatChitin/Named-Pipes described in this article: https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/864679/Creating-a-Server-Using-Named-Pipes

You ONLY need this code if you want to make a 100% compile of the FS_Telemetry_Server application https://github.com/upsidedownLS13/FS_Telemetry_Server. In this case compile this repository and place the resulting .dll in the server project.
It's open source, so.. here is the source :)
